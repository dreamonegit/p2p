<div class="abeadiing">
<span>Risks
</span>
</div>

<div class="abelcome-content">
The use of the Website and the Service may entail the following risks:

<div class="priva-ott">
<div class="aabelcome-content ">
1. Digital currency transactions are technically irreversible once it hits the network. The digital currencies you buy will be sent to your “Bit2atm”
wallet or to your own digital currency address provided. If you lose or delete your own digital currency wallet, you will lose your digital 
currencies in it and the same cannot be restored. The digital currency wallet address provided to you by “Bit2atm” is only a way for you to 
deposit or accept digital currency into your “Bit2atm” wallet. The owner of these digital currency wallet addresses will be “Bit2atm” and the 
outgoing transactions from these digital currency wallet addresses will not be related to you or to your “Bit2atm” account. When you send 
out digital currency from “Bit2atm” wallet to other digital currency address, the “From” address for such digital currency transaction will be a
temporary address and it won’t be same as the digital currency wallet address provided to you. If there are any chances of reversals or 
pay-back for a digital currency transaction you initiated from “Bit2atm”, it will be your responsibility to explicitly provide your digital currency 
address provided by “Bit2atm” to receive such digital currency payment. Any digital currency that is not send to your “Bit2atm” provided 
digital currency wallet address cannot be claimed to be from you. You also can neither request any reversals of such transaction nor 
request for the credit of those digital currency into digital currency balance in your account at “Bit2atm”.
</div>

<div class="aabelcome-content ">
2. Digital currency value tends to fluctuate on a minute to minute basis, due to which there may be increase or decrease in the value of the 
digital currencies. Digital currencies are subject to large swings in value and may even become worthless. There is an inherent risk that 
losses will occur as a result of buying, selling or trading in digital currencies.
</div>

<div class="aabelcome-content ">
3. Digital currency is an as-yet autonomous and largely unregulated worldwide system of value transfer between individuals. It is not backed
by any government or commodities and hence may be susceptible to risks not generally associated with government or central bank 
backed currencies.
</div>

<div class="aabelcome-content ">
4. There is also the risk of loss of confidence in digital currency trading, which could collapse demand relative to supply. For example, 
confidence might collapse in digital currency because of unexpected changes imposed by the software developers, the creation of 
superior competing alternatives, a deflationary or inflationary spiral, or due to governmental actions. Confidence might also collapse 
because of technical problems, for instance, if the anonymity of the system is compromised, or if any entity is able to prevent any
transactions from settling.
</div>

<div class="aabelcome-content ">
5. There may be additional risks that we have not foreseen or identified in these Terms of Use.<br />
<br />
You should carefully assess whether your financial situation and tolerance for risk is suitable for buying, selling or trading digital 
currencies. We use our banking service providers only for the receipt of client money and making payments. Our banking service providers 
do not transfer digital currencies, exchange digital currencies, or provide any services in connection with digital currencies.
